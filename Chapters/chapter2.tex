\chapter{Atomic Structure Calculations}\label{cha:atom_calc}

In this chapter, the procedure that follows a standard atomic structure calculation will be discussed and explained in detail. Topics ranging from the usage of the \gls{MCDFGME} code to compute  quantities such as energy levels, orbital wavefunctions and transition rates, to the manner in which these parameters can be used in order to simulate a theoretical spectrum will be explored. All the information present in this chapter was obtained after a thorough study of \gls{MCDFGME}'s manual~\cite{Desclaux_Indelicato_2019}.


\section{The \gls{MCDFGME} code's capabilities}
As previously stated, \gls{MCDFGME} is a program that allows for not only solving the many-body problem for an atomic system while making the proper \gls{QED} energy corrections, but also for the computation of a great deal of atomic parameters. Consulting~\cite{mcdfWebsite}, one can see that these include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy level calculations.
    \item Multipole radiative transition probabilities.
    \item Auger transition probabilities.
    \item Photoionization cross-sections.
    \item Electronic impact excitation cross-sections.
    \item Orbital wavefunction overlaps between same and different atomic systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{The atomic system at study}

Before proceeding with the explanation behind every step of the calculations performed, a previous discussion on the objective of the following calculations should be had.


The main purpose of this thesis is that of simulating a theoretical spectrum for Copper's emission lines when subjected to a near ionization threshold x-ray source.

At this energy range, two main processes will be responsible for an electron moving out of a core-shell: Resonant photoexcitation, and ionization.

While the simulation of the theoretical spectra for ionized Copper would be quite straightforward (due to the low shake probabilities at near ionization threshold energies, transitions for satellite states were not considered), the more extensive calculation is that of the resonant photoexcitation.

In order to fulfill the aim of simulating the theoretical spectra for this last phenomenon, multiple atomic structure calculations were computed for many of the excited state configurations for Copper.

In total, and in addition to ionized Copper, 18 different standalone calculations were performed for the case in which the atomic system has gone through the process of an excitation of any one of the constituent electrons to the following orbitals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f
    \item 5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, 5g
    \item 6s, 6p, 6d, 6f, 6g, 6h
    \item 7p, 8p, 9p
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Selecting all possible orbital configurations}

In order to perform an atomic structure calculation, by making use of the \gls{MCDFGME} code, the system's electronic configuration is needed, hence why, for each calculation, all the possible one-hole and two-holes configurations\footnote{These need to be considered due to describing the final state of the system after an Auger transition or Shake-off process. The Auger transition rates will be needed in order to compute the full width of the initial 1-hole level and diagram transitions.} need to be provided, along with their respective labels which are used as identifiers of the orbital where the hole is present during the following calculations. For example, in the case of ground state Copper that went through the process of the excitation of one of its electrons to the orbital 4p, there are many possibilities for the original orbital from where the electron came from. For this case, an example of all possible 1-hole and 2-holes configurations can be found in Annex~\ref{an:confs}. These are obtained by running a single, or two holes by all the orbitals present in the ground state configuration.


\section{Level Calculations}
Now that all configurations have been selected, the calculations can proceed.

The first step needed to be performed in order to simulate theoretical spectra is the calculation of the level structure for all given configurations.

This, however, is no simple task. Besides the given configuration, an atomic level is described by two other quantum numbers.

\subsection{The level manifold}




Prior to proceeding with the discussion, it is important to establish some of the notation that will be used throughout this thesis. In this work, an atomic level will be described by three sets of quantum numbers. These will be the parameters that will influence the system's energy levels.

\paragraph{Hole orbital labels}


$\qty(n\ l_j)$ - This quantum number set is related to the system's electronic configuration and can be composed of one or more labels, indicators of the orbitals where electrons are missing. These labels may have no physical meaning on their own and are used in conjunction with files such as the one in Annex~\ref{an:confs} in order to retrieve the system's electronic configuration
For demonstrative purposes, assuming an initial Copper's ground state configuration as a starting point, before any hole-generating processes, to be $1\text{s}^2\ 2\text{s}^2\ 2\text{p}^6\ 3\text{s}^2\ 3\text{p}^6\ 3\text{d}^{10}\ 4\text{s}^1$, the quantum number set in question can be used to describe various possible ionization states:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $1\text{s}^1\ 2\text{s}^2\ 2\text{p}^6\ 3\text{s}^2\ 3\text{p}^6\ 3\text{d}^{10}\ 4\text{s}^1  \rightarrow \qty(1\text{s})$
    \item $1\text{s}^1\ 2\text{s}^1\ 2\text{p}^6\ 3\text{s}^2\ 3\text{p}^6\ 3\text{d}^{10}\ 4\text{s}^1 \rightarrow \qty(1\text{s},2\text{s})$
\end{itemize}




\paragraph{Total angular momentum number}


$J$ - This number is the indicator of the total angular momentum of the atomic system, resulting from the couplings between the electrons'  orbital angular momenta and the electrons' spin. A single configuration can result in many coupling schemes, resulting in different couplings and, in turn, different values for $J$.

As an example, let's take that of Copper that went through the excitation process of an electron originally in the orbital 2p that is now in 4p, with an electron configuration of $1\text{s}^2\ 2\text{s}^2\ 2\text{p}^5\ 3\text{s}^2\ 3\text{p}^6\ 3\text{d}^{10}\ 4\text{s}^1\  4\text{p}^1 $. One can now easily observe there are three different open orbitals, each with an uncoupled electron. The different coupling possibilities between these three electrons will generate four different possible total angular momentum values: $J=\sfrac{1}{2},\ \sfrac{3}{2},\ \sfrac{5}{2},\ \sfrac{7}{2}$. In table \ref{tab:tot_ang_mom}, a coupling example will be given for each of them.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Lagrange multiplier} $\epsilon$ - Indicator of the eigenvalue for the state on which the calculation will be performed on. The need for this quantum number arises from the fact that, even for the same configuration and the same total angular momentum, there are many possible arrangements that yield these quantum numbers. As an example, for the same configuration used previously, and assuming a total angular momentum $J=\sfrac{5}{2}$, there are three different possible couplings that generate that value of angular momentum, as can be seen in table \ref{tab:epsilon}.


\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Same total angular momentum generated by different configurations}\label{tab:epsilon}
    \rowcolors{1}{}{GhostWhite}
    \begin{tabular}{cc| cc | cc}
        \toprule\multicolumn{6}{c}{$J=\sfrac{5}{2}$}\\\midrule
        \multicolumn{2}{c|}{2p}&\multicolumn{2}{c|}{4s}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{4p}\\
        $m_l$ & $m_s$ & $m_l$&$m_s$&$m_l$&$m_s$\\\midrule
        $1$&$-\sfrac{1}{2}$&$0$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$&$1$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$\\
        $1$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$&$0$&$-\sfrac{1}{2}$&$1$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$\\
        $1$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$&$0$&$\sfrac{1}{2}$&$1$&$-\sfrac{1}{2}$\\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

This splitting of quantum numbers for a given configuration gives origin to the level manifold (Figure~\ref{fig:manifold}), reason why, even for a simple calculation, hundreds to thousands of levels need to be calculated. It is also of note that, for a given Total angular momentum value, $J$, there are $2J+1$ states associated to it due to the angular momentum projection. In the presence of an external \gls{EMF}, the hyperfine level structure would be observed, due to Zeeman and Stark's effects. However, for the purpose of this thesis, no external field was considered, and calculations were only done for the maximum total angular momentum projection value, with a $2J+1$ degeneracy taken into account in the following calculations.

In conclusion, an atomic level can be defined by the set of these three quantum numbers. In the notation used throughout this thesis, a level will be identified by:

\begin{equation}
    i\equiv \qty[(n\ l_j)_i;\ J_i;\ \epsilon_i],
\end{equation}

And the energy of the level:

\begin{equation}
    E_i\equiv E \qty[(n\ l_j)_i;\ J_i;\ \epsilon_i],
\end{equation}



\subsection{Level calculation with \gls{MCDFGME}}
\todo{Mention that the program works by the means of an input f05 file}
\todo{Breit can be used as self consistent or perturbative}
\todo{Talk about Lorentz and Coulomb gauges}

A typical level calculation begins with the formatting of the input \verb|.f05| file. This file contains the necessary information and instructions the program needs for the computation that follows when the executable \verb|mcdfgme2019.exe| is called.

The input file has a certain input structure in which certain calculation parameters are defined. A previously tailored template input file is used, where, by default, the full Breit interaction is considered, with the magnetic and retardation parts, as well as vacuum polarization  included in the self-consistent process. Retardation is also applied to Lorentz's and Coulomb's gauges.

The template is now formatted in order to perform the calculation for the desired level. The element's atomic number and the electron configuration are selected with the former having the same format as in Annex~\ref{an:confs}. The double of the value of the  total angular momentum is then indicated (as not to work with non-integer values) and so is the Lagrange multiplier/eigenvalue.

There are many other parameters to chose in order to have the \verb|.f05| ready for the computation. These parameters, however, are not always the same, since occasionally different methods will have to be employed in order to reach convergence. Before these methods are discussed, it is necessary to provide an explanation as to how to evaluate the numerical convergence of the calculation:

\subsubsection{Evaluating the convergence}
After launching the \verb|mcdfgme2019.exe| executable, the computation will start, generating an output file with the \verb|.f06| extension, where the output will be written while the program is actively running.

One of the convergence benchmarks can already be evaluated while the calculation is being processed. Actively monitoring the output file with, as an example, the \verb|UNIX| command \verb|tail|, one can observe some output from the self-consistent cycles. Should the numerical method not be reaching proper convergence, some warnings concerning sudden shifts in the wavefunction derivative may be displayed.

The calculation can also be aborted due to a numerical error. In this case, if the error occurred while running calculations for a certain orbital(s), this/these will be displayed on the error output. 

The three other parameters used when evaluating if the convergence was successful can be checked only after the calculation is over:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each cycle, a component of the level's energy is calculated through two different methods. These two values should be consulted for the last cycle and the absolute energy difference should be below a certain stipulated benchmark value ($1\ \si{\electronvolt}$).
    \item The wavefunction overlaps between each orbital sharing the same $l_j$ value are displayed, since these cases are the most probable of having a convergence error leading them not to be orthogonal. The convergence is considered acceptable if every value is lower than $10^{-6}$.
    \item For every orbital, the effective charge is calculated and displayed. This parameter is related to the shielding effect the charge of the electrons in other orbitals exert on the nuclear charge. If the calculation converged correctly, these values should never be equal to the extreme possible values: $1$ or $N$, where $N$ is the total number of electrons. For each orbital, this value should be close to an expected value \todo{Meter aqui ref de como calcular}.
\end{itemize}





\subsubsection{Level convergence methods}

\paragraph{First attempt at numerical convergence}
For the first calculation, by default, a simpler template file (Annex~\ref{an:first_cycle}) is used and a calculation of five self-consistent cycles is performed. All  trial orbital wavefunctions are initialized by wavefunctions calculated using the Thomas Fermi potential~\cite{thomas_1927}.





\paragraph{Second attempt at numerical convergence}
Should the first attempt have failed to reach convergence, a similar calculation is performed, keeping the previous parameters, but increasing the number of self-consistent cycles to 10, enforcing for each, an increasingly more precise accuracy and higher number of iterations. The template can be found in Annex~\ref{an:second_cycle}.


\paragraph{Third attempt at numerical convergence}
Should the previous two attempts have been made, and no convergence was reached, a new calculation needs to be made. In addition to the change cycle parameters, the parameters for some orbitals are to be altered. This can be done by altering the initial wavefunction to hydrogenics, or to a previously computed one. The method for solving the Dirac equation can also be changed for each chosen orbital. This final attempt can be quite time-consuming due to the many possibilities and combinations of methods to be employed for each orbital.


Since for every different studied system there are thousands of levels associated to it, a parallelized automation script was used. In total two scripts were used: a first one, previously written in \verb|bash| by one of the advisors, Jorge Machado, which used the \verb|parallel| \verb|UNIX| command  for parallelization, was used for the first calculations performed; and for most of the calculations, a new script, developed in the scope of this thesis, written in \verb|Python| and employing an \verb|MPI| approach for the purpose of parallelization. This last one will be discussed further in the thesis.

In total, the total number of 1-hole and 2-holes calculated levels is displayed in table??
